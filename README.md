## Description

This contract is a small token , where we store variables like Token name, Token Abbrv, Totol supply .Then we need to map the address of the user with there balance. After this , we define functions like mint() and burn() , which helps us to add or sub the values passed form the parameter to our balances . Also , we will define some conditions which help us to decide whether the transaction should occur or not.
